## Cheat Sheets
Arithmetic operators  
Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators:  

| Expression | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x + y`    | Addition `+` operator returns the sum of x plus y                                               |
| `x - y`    | Subtraction `-` operator returns the difference of x minus y                                     |
| `x * y`    | Multiplication `*` operator returns the product of x times y                                     |
| `x / y`    | Division `/` operator returns the quotient of x divided by y                                     |
| `x**e`     | Exponent `**` operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e                        |
| `x**2`     | Square expression returns x squared                                                             |
| `x**3`     | Cube expression returns x cubed                                                                 |
| `x**(1/2)` | Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x               |
| `x // y`   | Floor division `//` operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y          |
| `x % y`    | Modulo `%` operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y                 |

## Order of operations
The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order:  

**P**arentheses ( ), { }, [ ]

**E**xponents x<sup>e</sup> (`x**e`)

**M**ultiplication * and **D**ivision /  

**A**ddition + and **S**ubtraction -    

 You might find the **PEMDAS** mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.
